1. .doc is unsupported by python-docx, so I only handle 
   .docx and will note this as an assumption in the PR.

2. for chunker type [FIXED, DECISION]. There is many approaches to chose based 
   on like # of imgs, headers, tables there, paragraph variation coefficient, 
   even embedding variation or any statistical analysis, llm as a judge and etc. 
   However, and due to task limitation of pkgs to use (e.g., pypdf, python-docx), 
   these existing parsers are too weak to capture document layout, and 
   due to task limitation and infra limitation I cant go with layout 
   aware parser (e.g., marker, document pretrained transformer (DPT), 
   llamaindex, ...) locally on my machine maybe I just go and aanlyze docuemnt text and search for
   hardcoded words or signals to select chunker type based on, but this
   will fail and require extensive analysis and domain knowledge.

   Well, we can choose one single chunking mechanisim that handels boath, but
   since the task describtion forces me to do this decision manually, I'll avoid 
   doing this :) 


   I'll go forward with simple thresholding mecha, paragraph len variation, due to deadline
   limitation.

3. Ive used multilingual `text-embedding-3-large` embed model, so no need for extra efforts
   on normalizing arabic text

4. Graph RAG and RAPTOR were deemed unsuitable based on architectural 
   analysis: Graph RAG requires reliable entity extraction across diverse 
   domains (legal, medical, technical) which is fragile and computationally 
   expensive when document types are unknown at ingestion, 
   while RAPTOR assumes hierarchical document structure that doesn't exist 
   in mixed user uploads (forms, notes, contracts, reports). 
   Instead, I adopted a multi-stage hybrid architecture combining vector similarity 
   search, BM25 keyword matching, and metadata filtering to handle 
   multi-domain semantic drift. Cross-encoder re-ranking provides 
   second-stage scoring to improve top-k precision, while lightweight
   agentic reflection enables iterative query refinement when initial retrieval 
   fails—critical for cross-domain queries. This approach balances retrieval
    quality with implementation simplicity and maintainability for 
    unknown document types.
