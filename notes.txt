1. .doc is unsupported by python-docx, so I only handle 
   .docx and will note this as an assumption in the PR.

2. for chunker type [FIXED, DECISION]. There is many approaches to chose based 
   on like # of imgs, headers, tables there, paragraph variation coefficient or 
   even embedding variation and etc. However, and due to task limitation of pkgs 
   to use (e.g., pypdf, python-docx), these existing parsers are too weak to capture
   document layout, and due to task limitation and infra limitation I cant
   go with layout aware parser (e.g., marker, DPT, lamaindex, ...) locally
   on my machine maybe we just go and aanlyze docuemnt text and search for
   hardcoded words or signals to select chunker type based on, but this
   will fail and require extensive analysis and domain knowledge.

   Well, we can choose one single chunking mechanisim that handels boath, but
   since the task describtion forces me to do this decision manually, I'll avoid 
   doing this :) 


   I'll go forward with simple thresholding mecha, paragraph len variation, due to deadline
   limitation.

3. Ive used multilingual `text-embedding-3-large` embed model, so no need for extra efforts
   on normalizing arabic text
